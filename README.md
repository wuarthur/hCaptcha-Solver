WIP - Has successfully solved captcha around 3 times in testing. Working on making it faster so it doesn't expire.

This captcha solver uses yandex reverse image search to identify what the image is. If Yandex's result matches the captcha item, it selects it.

This is just a proof of concept and I know its not the best way of bypassing hCaptcha by far.
